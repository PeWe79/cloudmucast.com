title: About These Docs
---

CloudmuCast now bundles a standalone version of our documentation along with every installation. This is useful for two reasons:

 - If you're ever offline or running CloudmuCast in an environment with limited connectivity, you can still reference our documentation as needed.

 - If you're running an older version of CloudmuCast than the current version, your local documentation will still correspond to the instructions for your version.

You can view the live documentation on our homepage at any time from the link in the sidebar.
